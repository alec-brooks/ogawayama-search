<h1><a name="sagan">Sagan Slab - Left Bank Slabs</a></h1>
<h2>This is the area centred on the tapering slab on the right bank 
(going up) of Hachiman Zawa. There are many quality routes, almost all 
of which are slab routes on excellent rock.</h2>
<h3>Follow the Kimpu San highway to the chain. Just past the big stream 
coming down from the right (Hachiman Zawa), a path cuts off right and 
leads up and back into the stream. This path avoids Victor, an immensely
 popular boulder in the stream bed. Higher up, the path crosses the 
stream by Tada no Oo Iwa, skirts Sagan Slab itself, then cuts right up 
the hill side at a tiny subsidiary stream to the Haru no Modori Yuki 
area.</h3>

<h1><a name="tada">Tada no Oo Iwa - Justabig Rock</a></h1>
<h2>This is the big boulder in the stream bed below Sagan Slab. The 
build-up of stones behind the dam just below it has knocked a couple of 
metres off Romancing the Stone and WAKA, and may well be the reason why 
the former has been relieved of its bolts.</h2></font>

<h2>The right fork in the stream below Hachiman Iwa leads up and under 
Ootaki ('The Big Waterfall'). The waterfall itself is normally no more 
than a trickle. There are two aid lines on rickety bolts to the left of 
the fall. The right face of this gives the routes described here, most 
of which are impressive cracklines. All the routes require a full rack 
of gear. Apart from Tomokazu Route and the first pitch of Sayonara 
Momoe-chan Route, the routes are never climbed. The bolts are all old 
(ring bolts or RCC bolts) and, along with any tat on them, to be treated
 with suspicion if not contempt.</h2>
<h3>From the approach to Hachiman Iwa, take the big right fork in the 
stream. This becomes a faint path that passes under the crag (and leads 
eventually to the Kamoshika Hiking Course, possibly via Mumei Ganpou).</h3></font>

 for a few metres past a peg to a crap bolt, then traverse back into the
 corner (now a chimney) and squirm through to emerge below a dirty 
corner on the far side. According to the original description, climb the
 corner past ancient threads to a tree belay on a good ledge. However, 
all the likely trees looked dead to me, so it's better (and far more 
logical) to belay on the comfortable terrace after you squirm out of the
 chimney.<br>
<b>Pitch 3. 5.7</b> According to the original description, move out left
 to a crack, climb this and layback the big flake above to the top. I 
couldn't find this - it may have been obscured by bush.
<br>If you do climb to the top, ab the route, or ab off via the top of 
Kazehana Route. Note that if you belay immediately after the squeeze, 
you can walk off - drop down to the left (facing out) into trees, walk 
down to a slight col, then scramble down a short corner to the hillside 
and circle round to the right to the start of the route.

<h3>The crags can be gained by heading up and right from Ootaki, but I'd
 only recommend this if you're already climbing in that area (and have 
some idea of what's where). It's far less tiring and distressing to 
follow the Kamoshika Hiking Course up past Modoki Iwa. For the lower 
section, cut off the path on the first bend after Tiny slab (i.e., 
before you climb the first ladder) and drop down a steep gully - the 
rocks are on the right and a promontory on the left gives you a good 
vantage point from which you can decide not to bother before too much 
damage is done.</h3>
