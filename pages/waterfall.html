<h2 align="center">This section deals with the crags passed along or 
accessed from the Kamoshika Hiking Course leading from the top campsite 
to Karasawa Waterfall. These are hard to work out from the campsite. The
 most prominent is Toride Iwa, the steep, east-facing curtain of rock 
set high on the slope.<br>
The waterfall is worth seeing in its own right, especially after rain. 
It should take about 35 minutes to get there. Rather than going back the
 way you came, you can turn the hike into a neat 90-minute circuit by 
following the path across the stream and climbing to join Shin Ogawayama
 Hiking Course on the ridge above Sagan Slab. From here, turn left 
(right takes you to Ogawayama peak) and follow the path along the ridge,
 up and down some short ladders, before dropping down and passing by 
Tiny Slab and Modoki Iwa, among others, on the way down to the campsite.</h2>

<h2>The big wall set back in the valley and high on the hillside 
provides some excellent steep slabs, faces and cracks. Some of the 
routes are rarely climbed and can be quite dirty. 2001/2002 saw a lot of
 development in this area across to the left of Shinrin Escalator. And 
some of the routes are very good. Others, not so. And some haven't been 
reported.</h2>
<h3>Follow the Kamoshika Hiking Course towards the waterfall. About 5 
minutes after Ojisan Iwa, where the main path fords a stream, follow a 
smaller path upstream on the right of the stream, eventually breaking 
off uphill. There is (2017) a big red cross tacked to a tree on this 
path to discourage unsuspecting hikers. The path winds up past some 
boulders into a hollow. The face on the right has an attractive bolted 
line (Shirakaba) right of a flake (Ocean Blue). Follow a fainter path 
left to the chimney at the start of Arch Crack and on to the new areas, 
or follow the continuation path more steeply to the main crag.<br>
It should take about 20 minutes to get to Shirakaba and a further 5~10 minutes to get to the other areas from there.</h3>

The big crackline slanting to the left eats Friends. A couple of 
monsters are handy, but not essential. Note that, as described below, 
apart from the top of Pitch 1, you are always belaying on gear.<br>
The route is shown as 3 pitches in the topos, but rope drag and common sense suggest 4 is a better option.</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="3">
<b>Pitch 1. 5.8</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (12m) Climb up some tree roots to a
 recessed chimney. Follow this past a couple of chockstones to a 
desperate thrutch onto a ledge. If you don't fancy the thrutch, you can 
swing out left on a good hold before things get nasty. Belay on good 
trees below a large flake.<br>
<b>Pitch 2. 5.9</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (15m) Climb the flake (hard to 
start, but it soon eases) to a conundrum. You want to be in the 
left-facing corner up and left. Either scratch up the dirty face to the 
hang and make a thin pull round into the corner, or step down and left 
(off the flake) to a good tree and use this to pull back right into the 
corner. The corner gives excellent jamming and laybacking to a niche 
below a short wide crack.<br>
Some topos mark the top of the first pitch as a tree at the top of the 
flake. Either the tree pulled or they mean the tree out left of the 
flake (which doesn't look like it's been used for belaying).<br>
<b>Pitch 3. 5.10a</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (13m) Squeeze up to the 
off-width and make a couple of hard pulls to sinking jams in a crack 
leading left. Traverse the crack out left to a bigger recess and belay. A
 superb pitch!<br>
<b>Pitch 4. 5.9</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (20m) Chimney up to the roof, then
 follow a good crack out left underneath it. Where the roof peters out, 
either pull right into a short off-width and thrutch to the summit or 
continue left and climb an easy short crack.<br>
To descend, drop down over the back of the rock (in front of Toride Iwa)
 and then walk down. To drop down from the top of the rock, it is 
possible to climb down the shortest side, but better and safer to rig up
 an ab (in which case, be prepared to leave some tat).

<h2>There is quite a lot of rock situated just up and left of the Pocket
 Mantel Rocks. It's not far from the main path, but not immediately 
obvious, especially in summer. Apart from Fuyu no Izanai, the routes are
 rarely climbed. The popularity of the area is not helped by the 
confusing way in which the topos are presented in the current Kitayama 
guide. I'll try to make a bit more sense of it here.</h2>
<h3>To get here, follow the Kamoshika Hiking Course past the end of the 
huge cracked face left of Pocket Mantel. The path starts to zig-zag and 
passes a large undercut boulder with a big red spot painted just where 
you wouldn't want to bang your head. In 2015, a length of black and 
yellow rope was strung across here to dissuade hikers from heading up to
 the rocks. For Fuyu no Izanai etc., break off from the path to the 
waterfall, dip under the rope and zig-zag up to a whitish face.<br>
