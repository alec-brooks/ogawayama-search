rocks centred on Godzilla Iwa, which line the north slope of the next 
prominent stream south of Karasawa. Part of this appeared in old topos

Godzilla Iwa was a different rock on the opposite side of the stream).<br>
For the interested, there is a huge face (referred to as Godzilla no Ie -
 Godzilla's Lair - in the old topos) on the south side of the south 
slope of this stream. From a distance this is a gobsmacker, but not so 
hot from closer up. Still, there are lines to be had and signs of 
development. There are also many fresh rockfall scars!</h2></font>

<h2>This is a two-tiered slab found by your correspondent on the slopes 
below and right of Godzilla. And though I say so myself, it is an 
excellent venue for a day's slabbing.</h2>
<h3>Follow the Kimpu-san highway for not quite three kilometres to a 
small shrine on the right (about 500m after Phoenix Rock). Leave the 
highway and follow the stream bed just right of the shrine for 30m till 
blocked by a rock step. If this is dry, scramble up the first couple of 
metres of rock and then just keep heading up the stream. If the rock 
step is too wet, take a detour through grassy woods just right of the 
stream (cairns) to return to it about 50m higher up (if in doubt, head 
back left to the stream). Continue to a prominent cube of a boulder in 
the stream, then cross it and zig-zag up to a big slab on the left. 
Prends ton Temps &amp; Co. start where the slab tapers almost to a point
 by a huge fallen cypress. It should take about 45 minutes from the 
campsite.<br>

<h2>The granite blob on top of the ridge between Phoenix and Godzilla 
has been omitted from the last few Japanese guides. It is much easier to
 find if you know where Godzilla and Kaseijin are. There are four good 
crack routes and a couple of bizarre, recently bolted lines. On all the 
routes, the rock is a bit crunchy for the first couple of metres and the
 gear is excellent.</h2>
<h3>Follow the Highway to Phoenix Rock. There is, according to the old 
topo, a 30m slab called Warming Up Slab just past Phoenix Rock on the 
right, and a path leading way up the gully from here to Inseki, passing a
 couple of other crags on the way. I couldn't find this, so: About 50m 
past Phoenix Rock on the right, an old wide forestry track breaks off up
 the slope. Follow this. It bends left then levels off and ends at a 
cairn after about 150m. From just before its end, zig-zag up the slope 
at an overall right angle to the track to a small outcrop. From the top 
of this, intermittent red tape leads you up the slope to a gully with a 
slab on the right (Escalator, 3P, 5.8 goes up there somewhere). Keep the
 rock on your right (this opens up into the huge face of Perseid Meteor 
Shower) and keep slogging up till the rock runs out and the path levels 
slightly. From here, the tape starts again and leads quickly to the rock
 under the cracks of Melting Jam and Cleaning Windows.</h3></font>

slanting corner using the amazing detached flake on the left. Use a thin
 slanting crack to pull up to the top of the corner (crux) and then make
 an awkward pull right (gritty, but excellent jams and gear) to gain a 
spacious ledge. Belay on the tree and cams at its right end (facing in).<br>

rib behind the belay to another ledge. Climb the steep slab above past a
 brown flake to join Nagareboshi Meguri at the first summit, drop down 
over the back and scramble easily to the true summit. Block belays.<br>
