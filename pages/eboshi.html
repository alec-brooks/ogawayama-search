<h2>This is the name of the big group of walls and towers high on the 
hillside above and right of Mara Iwa. While the scale is impressive, the
 quality and condition of the rock can be disappointing. The left ridge 
of the area is climbed by Saryousen, by far the longest route at 
Ogawayama. Further right and starting higher up is the steep wall of 
Eboshi Main. Right again and lower down are the slabs of Ura Eboshi. 
Musasabi Route climbs the big broken face up and right again. Eboshi, 
incidentally, is the name of a traditional type of hat, usually black 
and knob-shaped.</h2>

<h3>Cross Nishi Matasawa as for Mara Iwa, but take the first fork right 
in the path, about 70m up from the stream. This is an old forestry 
track. About 50m along this, a cairn on the left marks the path for 
Saryousen. A further 50m along another cairn marks the path left for 
Eboshi Main and Ura Eboshi. After 200m climbing pleasantly through the 
woods, another cairn marks the left fork to Eboshi Main. This path is 
quite well marked with red tape, which is a bit of a waste because 
nobody goes there.<br>
If you stay on the old forestry track, you will eventually hit the main stream again and the Kimpu-san Highway at Phoenix Rock.</h3>
<p>At some stage, I will add a map and/or topo, but until then, these descriptions will have to do.

</p><h1><a name="saryousen">Saryousen</a></h1>
<h3>Altogether, this should take about 25 minutes from the campsite. 
From the old forestry track, take the first path leading left into the 
woods. The turning is prominently marked with a cairn and smaller cairns
 lead you quickly through the woods to the base of a scree slope. Follow
 the marked path up this till, about level with the top of Mara Iwa on 
your left, the path crosses the (usually) dry stream on the right and 
heads back into woods around the base of the ridge. The descent route 
will not bring you back this way, so only carry what you need on the 
rock after you leave the old forestry track.</h3></font>
