<a name="thumb"><h1>Oyayubi Iwa - The Thumb</h1></a>
<h2>The pinnacle in the woods left (south) of the upper campsite has 
always struck me as more of a circumcised dick than a thumb, but there 
you go. This is a small crag with more than its fair share of quality 
routes.</h2>

<h3>Take the left fork on the righthand bend on the track that sweeps 
round the car park. This leads past a washstand and through the cluster 
of rentatent platforms into woods. (Don't follow the left, downhill fork
 after the washstand). The path climbs steeply to the right and weaves 
round a bouldering area to the crag. If it takes more than 10 minutes, 
you're lost. From this approach, the crag appears as a broad crunchy 
slab. Other paths lead up from the lower campsites and across from the 
higher campsites and things can get confusing. For Ogawayama Layback and
 Koyubi Iwa, skirt the crunchy slab to the left. For Crazy Jam and 
Maginot line, skirt the slab to the right.</h3>

<a name="little"><h1>Koyubi Iwa - The Little Finger</h1></a>
The first two routes are on the smaller slab to the left of the pinnacle.<br>
(There is also an unclaimed line up the short slab a few metres up the 
gully to the left. I make it 5.10b and worthwhile, but it needs a 
lower-off.)<br></font>

<h3>Follow the main track up from the carpark to the second big 
righthand bend. Follow the broad track going straight off this into the 
woods. This then narrows and veers right and uphill to a bouldering 
venue called Kujira Iwa - Whale Rock. The path weaves uphill between

The bolted line pulling right out of Dog Flake has a lovely top slab 
that looks great from the campsite, but you have to climb a 15m carpet 
of moss to get there - maybe that's why it hasn't been publicised. There
 was some new route activity up here in 2006. 3 one-pitch routes (from 
the left 5.10d, 5.11c, 5.12a) were climbed up near Dog Flake - more
