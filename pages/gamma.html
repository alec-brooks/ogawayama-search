<h3>Follow the Kimpu-san Highway past the chain and past the entry for 
Sagan Slab. The track then detours round a big rockfall on the right 
(Nightnurse RIP) and, about 50m after this, a huge cairn marks a small 
path leading up in 50m to the base of a broad, low-angled slab, which 
offers a choice of first pitches for Gamma Route. This path then skirts 
the slab on the left and leads up to the slab containing Gamma Route 
pitch 2. The path from the second cairn on the Kimpu-san Highway leads 
directly to the left edge of the lower slab. 
(Point of interest: After the rockfall, a track forks left to the river -
 <a href="https://ogawayama.online/pics/GammaPoolSmall1.jpg" onclick="NewWindow(this.href,'name','815','615','no');return false;">a superb spot for a dip</a>.)</h3>

The first four or five lines from the left (up to and including the line that pulls up a <a href="https://ogawayama.online/pics/gammaflake.jpg" onclick="NewWindow(this.href,'name','615','815','no');return false;">neat white flake</a>)
 are 5.6 - 5.8. Whichever pitch you choose to take, from the top-left of
 the slab, follow a path left to the start of the second pitch - a neat 
slim flake starting from the toe of the main slab.<br>
<b>Pitch 2. 5.9</b> Layback the flake to the bolt at its end and 
traverse right along a dike. Smear up a white scoop to gain better holds
 and a ledge with two old trees and two spanking new chains.<br>
<b>Pitch 3. 5.8</b> Climb the easy slab behind the belay to a steep 
corner, passing possible belays on the right and left. Climb the corner,
 then belay at a tree in a gully. <br>
<b>Pitch 4. ---</b> Scramble right up the gully then left across easy 
slabs to a wooded slope. This is very easy, but beginners may require a 
rope. Walk about 20m diagonally left to the base of pitch 5. (Note: 
Pitch 5 starts up a juggy slab left of a gully and heads to an obvious 
curving flake in a slab up and left. If you're standing below a scruffy 
wall heading into treed slabs, and the first runner is a peg, possibly 
with red tape on it, you're too far up and right.)<br>

 Climb the easy slab for 10m to a steep section by a small tree. Pull up
 onto the next slab using a superb pocket, then continue to the big 
flake. Pull over this (crux) onto the top slab and continue to a big 
terrace. It is possible to make a 5.7 detour up the gully and crack to 
the right and to split the pitch at trees in the gully.<br>
<b>Pitch 6. ---</b> Make a scary step into the bottom of the bottomless 
gully (yes, I know) behind the belay then head up the gully to a good 
viewpoint on the ridge. Rope up as required.<br>
<b>Pitch 7. 5.4</b> Meander up the sleeping slabs to the top - a great 
spot for a picnic. Rope up as required. Watch you don't drop any gear 
into the deep cracks.<br></td></tr>

To descend, ab off down the back (i.e. down the impressive face of the 
top pitch of Kaze to Tomo ni Sarinu). If you have two ropes, you can get
 down in one ab, but tie a knot in the ends and head left (facing in). A
 short walk leads down to the path below Magga Slab. If you have one 
rope, ab to the anchor on the lower ledge below the steep face (the 
second anchor down - this is the top of Pitch 2 of Kaze to Tomo ni 
Sarinu) and ab again from here. Both abs are almost, but not quite, 25m.</td></tr>

<h3>Follow the Kimpu-san Highway past the cairn for Gamma Slab for 100 
metres or so to where a stream runs down from the right and passes under
 a steel grid on the highway. If you're inventive, you will spot the 
makings of a path running upstream on the right of the stream. Follow 
this, steeply at first, for about 50 metres and keep your eyes peeled 
for the second chunk of rock on the right of the path. The main path 
leads on past Puchi Rock to Gamma Summit; the path under Zoku Ojisan Iwa
 continues through jungle rightwards to KC's Banana Cake.<br>
The routes are described from left to right and share the same lower-off
 on a hollow flake - that, in May 2011, has no krab and could do with 
replacing. I would also recommend backing it up with slings on the tree 
just right.</h3></font>

A good steep pitch up the face above Kawaii Onna.</td></tr>

Start on the big terrace at the top of Kawaii Onna. Climb a short 
corner, then a left-leading line up the vertical face above to the 
terrace below the summit tower. There appear to be a few more bolts up 
there now, but nothing has been reported.</td></tr>

Start at the top of pitch 3 of Kaze to Tomo ni Sarinu. Move left to the

The short steep right face of the summit tower. The word is, this would 
be a lot more popular if it were a little more accessible.</td></tr>

Start in the centre of the face. Make a hard move to get started, then 
climb more easily to moves diagonally left past a pegged crack. Crux 
moves past a steep(er) section lead all too quickly to the top. The 
arete to the left is now bolted but unclaimed.</td></tr>
