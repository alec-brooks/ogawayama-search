Pull up onto the next slab using a superb pocket, then continue to the big flake. Pull over this (crux) onto the top slab and continue to a big terrace. It is possible to make a 5.7 detour up the gully and crack to the right and to split the pitch at trees in the gully.Pitch 6. --- Make a scary step into the bottom of the bottomless gully (yes, I know) behind the belay then head up the gully to a good viewpoint on the ridge.

Either scratch up the dirty face to the hang and make a thin pull round into the corner, or step down and left (off the flake) to a good tree and use this to pull back right into the corner. The corner gives excellent jamming and laybacking to a niche below a short wide crack.Some topos mark the top of the first pitch as a tree at the top of the flake.

Traverse the crack out left to a bigger recess and belay. A superb pitch!Pitch 4. 5.9\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (20m) Chimney up to the roof, then follow a good crack out left underneath it. Where the roof peters out, either pull right into a short off-width and thrutch to the summit or continue left and climb an easy short crack.To descend, drop down over the back of the rock (in front of Toride Iwa) and then walk down.
